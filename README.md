This was originally a commission, but with permission from the client we decided to release it. 

This is a very simple seatbelt script with LEO detection via a command.

Config is located in `data/config.lua` and locales are located within the `locales` directory.

[ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest) is required and must be started before this resource in order to use it.
